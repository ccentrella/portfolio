<%= @post.description %>

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my articles :). It means a lot and I hope that I may always let the Lord speak through me, to you.

If you so wish, please share this article with whoever is in need of a little love, be it friends, family, or on social media. My prayer is that my articles might be a light in the midst of darkness; of hope in the midst of the despair so present in our world today. In all things, let us "love one another, as I have loved you." (John 13:34)

In Christ,
Chris
