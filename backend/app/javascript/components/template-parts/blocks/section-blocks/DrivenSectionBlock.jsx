                <p>Since an early age, Iâ€™ve been a motivated learner that has continuously taught myself to code and design well. Throughout my entire learning journey, one thing has remained:</p>
                <h3>Become the best.</h3>
                <p>
                    This principle drives everything that I do. From learning cutting-edge approaches to AI, to several classes in Graphic Design to bring innovation, to mastering the latest programming languages and frameworks, everything is driven
                    by a desire to be the best.{" "}
