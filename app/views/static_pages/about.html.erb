        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="large justify">With an eye for <span class="keyword">detail</span> and a love for <span class="keyword">visual design</span>, I’m a young software engineer who wants to make a real and lasting <span class="keyword">difference</span> in this world we live in. My favorite specialties are <span class="keyword">UX</span> and <span class="keyword">artificial intelligence</span>, especially the field of <span class="keyword">computer vision</span>, where I can apply my love for visual design with state-of-the-art technology. Writing my first line of code when I was fourteen years old, I’ve since worked with several technologies, including HTML & CSS, Ruby on Rails, Python, C# and the .NET Framework, and a bit of Java and React. I also believe in the importance of <span class="keyword">prototyping</span> and using <span class="keyword">best practices</span> and methodologies including Git, Agile, and project management software.</p>
        
        <p class="large justify">Some <span class="keyword">activities</span> that I really enjoy are <span class="keyword">playing the guitar</span> and capturing beauty through <span class="keyword">photography</span>. I also love spending time in the <span class="keyword">outdoors</span>, and believe that <span class="keyword">nature</span> is a powerful means of connecting to ourselves and to God. It is a place of quiet, where I can put aside the noise and busyness of our world and gaze at the power and awe of our <span class="keyword">Creator</span>.</p>
       
       <p class="large justify">Above all, I’m a <span class="keyword">Christian</span> and take Jesus Christ as my personal <span class="keyword">Savior</span> and <span class="keyword">Lord</span>. How I wish every person would encounter his burning heart of <span class="keyword">love</span>, a love that went so far as to die willingly for us on a cross. I believe Jesus is the <span class="keyword">only cure</span> to our broken and hurting world and that it is only <span class="keyword">His love</span> that can bring true and <span class="keyword">authentic meaning</span> to our lives and everything that we do, in and outside of the workplace. I firmly believe that it is the <span class="keyword">Love of God</span> that ultimately <span class="keyword">heals us</span>, gives us <span class="keyword">hope</span>, and which gives <span class="keyword">meaning</span> to our existence; it gives reason to our being on this planet during this time in the unfolding of humanity.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p class="large">
            In my role as Lead Web Developer at Catholics for Hire, I've created several responsive websites from the ground up, using WordPress and the Elementor Page Builder. Here are a few of the sites that I've created. I've also prototyped this entire website, i.e., my portfolio, in Adobe XD, fully responsive and mobile-first. I've built the entire thing from the ground up, including the blog functionality, with a fully-functioning admin panel and continuous improvement and version control, using Git and following the Agile Methodology.

                Besides computer programming, I also enjoy writing about Jesus, so that people might encounter the One Who is madly in love with them. "Here is our King, Here is our Love, Here is our God who's come to bring us back to Him. He is the One. He is Jesus.
