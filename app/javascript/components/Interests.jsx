                    Outside of writing code or designing user experiences, some
                    of my favorite activities are blogging, photography, and
                    playing guitar.

                    My faith life is important to me and I love to write about
                    how to find God amid the twists and turns of life, and so
                    others might know more about Him.

                <p className="large">
                    Taking photos has been one of my favorite hobbies as early
                    as my childhood. In a world full of pain and division, my
                    mind is drawn to capture what’s truly beautiful. I
                    especially love to take pictures of nature, because there is
                    a sacredness and a beauty in the environment, unparalleled
                    by human invention. For “the heavens proclaim the glory of
                    God, and the firmament proclaims His handiwork.” (Psalm
                    19:1).

                    The past couple years, I’ve been trying to pick up playing
                    guitar, especially for worship. Picking up how to play a
                    musical instrument can be a lot of work, but I’m SLOWLY
                    getting there with a lot of practice.
