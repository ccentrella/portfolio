                What is most important in my software engineering career?

            <h3>
                Utilizing cutting-edge technologies to make a difference in
                people’s lives.

                I’ve always wanted to deliver the best, to bring customers the
                most refined and up-to-date experience, but in order to do this,
                it’s paramount that I consistently refine and improve my skills
                through ongoing, professional development. Only then can I
                deliver authentic value, to bring a rewarding customer
                experience and huge corporate profits.

            <h2>Artistic</h2>
            <p className="large">
                Nothing has more impact on human beings than the power of
                visuals. Our brains respond immediately to visuals, and visuals
                have a tremendous impact on how we perceive a product or
                service. This leads to one principle:
            </p>
            <h3>Art has the power to transform.</h3>
            <p className="large">
                Art is transformative in so many ways, but it always involves an
                impact on the viewer. Whether it’s converting clicks into leads,
                retaining customer contracts, or generating positive feedback
                through intuitive design, at its core art is about transforming
                the user experience and driving home a lasting impact. This
                resonates with me; visual design has impacted me in so many
                ways, and I’m so excited to drive the next generation of refined
                user experience through the power of art.

            <h2>Driven</h2>
            <p className="large">
                Since an early age, I’ve been a motivated learner that has
                continuously taught myself to code and design well. Throughout
                my entire learning journey, one thing has remained:
            </p>
            <h3>Become the best.</h3>
            <p className="large">
                This principle drives everything that I do. From learning
                cutting-edge approaches to AI, to several classes in Graphic
                Design to bring innovation, to mastering the latest programming
                languages and frameworks, everything is driven by a desire to be
                the best.{" "}
